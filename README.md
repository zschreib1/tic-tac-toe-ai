# tic-tac-toe-ai

Using Minimax, I implemented an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.

Starter code was provided for this project, which I completed for Harvard UniversityX's *CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python* course. 
There are two main files in this project: 
- *runner.py* contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game.
- *tictactoe.py* contains all of the logic for playing the game.

In *tictactoe.py* implemented the:
- *player, 
- *actions*, 
- *result*, 
- *winner*, 
- *terminal*, 
- *utility*, and 
- *minimax*
functions.

The tic tac toe board is represented as a list of three lists (representing the three rows of the board), where each internal list contains three values that are either X, O, or EMPTY. 


Run python runner.py to play against the AI.
